Very simple command line interface expense manager app. Add expenses and view summaries by day. It persists data to a text file.
This app is just to test skills in the Dart language.

Run 'dart run' in the directory from the command line to run the app.
Or 'dart compile exe bin/expense_tracker.dart' to build the exe.

A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`
